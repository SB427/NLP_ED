<p>Pour finir ce cours, on va s’intéresser aux derniers développements du NLP, les LLMs (Large Langage Models), fondés sur une architecture de Transformers et du mécanisme de l’attention.</p>

<p>L’idée est d’entraîner un modèle de langue, sur de très larges corpus, pour ensuite l’utiliser dans des tâches spécifiques.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="multitaches.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Exemples</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Il ne s’agit pas ici de réentraîner des modèles, ce qui est une approche tout à fait pertinente lorsque l’on est face à des corpus au langage spécifique, mais d’utiliser les outils existants directement disponibles.</p>
<p>Pour trouver le bon modèle à utiliser, il existe <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>. La plupart des éléments de code sont en python, mais il commence à exister des implémentations en R.</p>
<p>Le problème véritable repose sur les temps de calcul et la puissance disponible. On recommande d’avoir accès à un GPU, ce qui permet de considérablement raccourcir le temps des traitements. Les outils en R n’ont pas encore implémenté le recours au GPU, et nos ordis portables n’en ont pas forcément. On peut avoir recours au cluster de calcul de son université, ou utiliser les service de Google ou OpenAI (souvent, moyennant finance).</p>
<p>On va utiliser du code en python et du code en R pour analyser les résultats. On travaille sur un tout petit corpus, pour limiter les temps de calcul. On pourra garder un oeil sur le package R <a href="https://www.r-text.org/index.html">‘text’</a> qui propose beaucoup d’outils mais est encore en construction.</p>
<p>(Pour redémarrer la session R : command/ctrl + shift + F10)</p>

<pre><code>What is AI?

AI is a form of artificial intelligence that can be used to perform complex tasks. It is often referred to as machine learning or AI, but it is not a scientific term. Artificial intelligence is being used as a way to improve the way we think and interact with the world around us. For example, it has been shown that humans can learn from other humans in a number of ways, such as how they respond to a situation or what they say to each other. In this way, AI can improve our understanding of our world and our relationships with other people, as well as our ability to make decisions about how to live our lives. AI also has the potential to change how we live and what we do in the future. This is especially true when it comes to health, education, healthcare, and the environment, which can all be affected by the use of AI. However, there are still a lot of unanswered questions about what AI will do for us and how it</code></pre>
