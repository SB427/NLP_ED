	abstract = {This work examines the question of who is more likely to provide future helpful reviews in the context of online product reviews by synergistically using personality theories and data analytics. It trains a deep learning model to infer a reviewer’s personality traits. This enables analyses to reveal the role of personality traits in review helpfulness among a large population of reviewers. We develop hypotheses on how personality traits are associated with review helpfulness, followed by hypotheses testing that confirms that higher review helpfulness is related to higher openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness and to lower emotional stability. These results suggest the appropriateness of using these five personality traits as inputs for developing a model for predicting future review helpfulness. Based on an ensemble model using supervised classification algorithms, we develop a predictive model and demonstrate its superior performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a political economy approach to the grammar of institutions, by building on the study of contracts in economics. First, I argue that more attention needs to be paid to the costs and benefits of institutions, thus allowing researchers to derive empirically testable hypotheses on the evolution of institutions. In this vein, the role of conditions in studying the grammar of institutions becomes central. Second, I propose, validate, and test an innovative method to study the grammar, based on computational linguistics. This method allows extracting the elements of the grammar in an automated and unsupervised manner, paving the way to large-N­ analyses. In so doing, this article seeks to bridge the gap between public policy and political economy.},

	abstract = {This study examines whether user-generated content (UGC) is related to stock market performance, which metric of UGC has the strongest relationship, and what the dynamics of the relationship are. We aggregate UGC from multiple websites over a four-year period across 6 markets and 15 firms. We derive multiple metrics of UGC and use multivariate time-series models to assess the relationship between UGC and stock market performance.
            Volume of chatter significantly leads abnormal returns by a few days (supported by Granger causality tests). Of all the metrics of UGC, volume of chatter has the strongest positive effect on abnormal returns and trading volume. The effect of negative and positive metrics of UGC on abnormal returns is asymmetric. Whereas negative UGC has a significant negative effect on abnormal returns with a short “wear-in” and long “wear-out,” positive UGC has no significant effect on these metrics. The volume of chatter and negative chatter have a significant positive effect on trading volume. Idiosyncratic risk increases significantly with negative information in UGC. Positive information does not have much influence on the risk of the firm. An increase in off-line advertising significantly increases the volume of chatter and decreases negative chatter. These results have important implications for managers and investors.},

	abstract = {Smartphones have made it nearly effortless to share images of branded experiences. This research classiﬁes social media brand imagery and studies user response. Aside from packshots (standalone product images), two types of brand-related selﬁe images appear online: consumer selﬁes (featuring brands and consumers’ faces) and an emerging phenomenon the authors term “brand selﬁes” (invisible consumers holding a branded product). The authors use convolutional neural networks to identify these archetypes and train language models to infer social media response to more than a quarter-million brand-image posts (185 brands on Twitter and Instagram). They ﬁnd that consumer-selﬁe images receive more sender engagement (i.e., likes and comments), whereas brand selﬁes result in more brand engagement, expressed by purchase intentions. These results cast doubt on whether conventional social media metrics are appropriate indicators of brand engagement. Results for display ads are consistent with this observation, with higher click-through rates for brand selﬁes than for consumer selﬁes. A controlled lab experiment suggests that self-reference is driving the differential response to selﬁe images. Collectively, these results demonstrate how (interpretable) machine learning helps extract marketing-relevant information from unstructured multimedia content and that selﬁe images are a matter of perspective in terms of actual brand engagement.},

            How do democracies make decisions? We can read transcripts from parliament houses and legislative halls to see how particular ideas are introduced and debated, but we understand very little about the general principles of how these systems deal with information, or the origins of those principles. Here we study the parliamentary assembly of the first 2 years of the French Revolution, a model for democracies and revolutions across the globe, and show how patterns of speaking are created, picked up, and ignored or propagated. Political ideology, top–down rules, and individual charisma all affect how word patterns survive and thrive or, conversely, disappear and drop away.
          , 
            The French Revolution brought principles of “liberty, equality, fraternity” to bear on the day-to-day challenges of governing what was then the largest country in Europe. Its experiments provided a model for future revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern revolution had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates held in the Revolution’s first parliament, we present a quantitative analysis of how this body managed innovation. We use information theory to track the creation, transmission, and destruction of word-use patterns across over 40,000 speeches and a thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers’ individual qualities could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at higher rates, while speakers on the right acted to preserve prior patterns. Key players such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abbé Maury (on the right) played information-processing roles emblematic of their politics. Newly created organizational functions—such as the Assembly president and committee chairs—had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a distinct transition appears midway through the parliament when committees, external to the debate process, gained new powers to “propose and dispose.” Taken together, these quantitative results align with existing qualitative interpretations, but also reveal crucial information-processing dynamics that have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public’s attention, but deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the committee system gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.},

	abstract = {Marketing scholars increasingly use web scraping and application programming interfaces (APIs) to collect data from the internet. Yet, despite the widespread use of such web data, the idiosyncratic and sometimes insidious challenges in its collection have received limited attention. How can researchers ensure that the data sets generated via web scraping and APIs are valid? While existing resources emphasize technical details of extracting web data, the authors propose a novel methodological framework focused on enhancing its validity. In particular, the framework highlights how addressing validity concerns requires the joint consideration of idiosyncratic technical and legal/ethical questions along the three stages of collecting web data: selecting data sources, designing the data collection, and extracting the data. The authors further review more than 300 articles using web data published in the top ﬁve marketing journals and offer a typology of how web data have advanced marketing thought. The article concludes with directions for future research to identify promising web data sources and embrace novel approaches for using web data to capture and describe evolving marketplace realities.},

We propose an explanatory model of the performance of a message by taking into account the external cues (source and form of the message) beyond the content and meaning of the text, and we test it empirically, on a corpus of nearly 800,000 original tweets sent by about 235,000 users over a period of 7 months concerning the Covid-19 epidemic in France. We thus show the importance of the source’s credibility and its strategy on the platform, but also of the form of the post, its composition and its degree of elaboration. These elements are nuanced by the level of engagement of the source in the topic of conversation on which it intervenes and by the context in which these messages are sent and received.},
